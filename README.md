# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🚢

Welcome to the **Titanic-Dataset-EDA** repository! This project is dedicated to unraveling the stories behind one of the most famous datasets in the data science world — the Titanic passenger manifest. Through hands-on exploratory data analysis, we aim to discover the hidden trends, relationships, and insights within the data.

## ✨ Project Highlights

- **Clean & Documented EDA**: Step-by-step data cleaning, visualization, and feature exploration.
- **Visualization Galore**: Attractive and informative charts using popular Python data viz libraries.
- **Survival Analysis**: What factors most influenced survival? We dig deep!
- **Reproducible Code**: All notebooks and scripts are designed for easy reproducibility.

## 🚀 How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FUTURA-X/Titanic-Dataset-EDA.git
   ```
2. **Set up your environment** *(suggested: Python 3.8+)*:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Explore the notebooks**:
   - Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and run the EDA scripts in Jupyter Lab or Notebook.

4. **Bring Your Own Insights**:
   - Fork, modify, and submit a pull request to extend the analysis or add new visualizations!

## 💡 Key Questions Explored

- How did age and sex affect survival rates?
- Was socioeconomic status (Pclass) a major factor?
- What groups of passengers had the highest risk?
- Can we predict survival based on ticket fare, cabin, or embarkation point?
